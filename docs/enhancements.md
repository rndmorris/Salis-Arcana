calculating vis discounts, runic armor, and focus pouches containing wand foci.

## Look-a-like Plank Blocks

**Config option:** `enableLookalikePlanks`

Adds decorative Greatwood and Silverwood plank blocks that behave as normal blocks should. Allows using those textures

## Crucible+Thaumatorium Heat Source Ore Dict
Config Option: `heatSourceOreDict`

If enabled, blocks with the ore dictionary tag `salisarcana:heatSource` will be treated as crucible heat sources.

Mod devs: for added convenience, this string constant is available through Salis Arcan's API.

Allows the Thaumometer to scan the contents of containers (eg. chests, barrels) when scanning the block.

## Free Research Duplication

Config Option: `researchDuplicationFree` (default: false)

Research duplication (in the Research Table and, if `nomiconDuplicateResearch` is enabled, in the Thaumonomicon) will not cost any research aspects when this setting is enabled.

## Thaumcraft Command

## Research Item Extensions

Config Option: `researchItemExtensions`

Adds additional functionality to internal research data. Used for compatibility with other mods (e.g. Automagy, Thaumic Tinkerer).

Mod authors: this controls whether Thaumcraft's `ResearchItem` class implements `IResearchItemExtended` from Salis Arcana's API package.

## Enhancements - Creative Mode

Prevent random warp events from occurring for players in creative mode.

**Config option:** `stopCreativeModeItemConsumption`

Right-clicking while viewing research will navigate back to the previous research, or to the Thaumonomicon if there
is no research to navigate back to.

**Config option:** `Show Research Key`

Holding Ctrl while hovering over research in the Thaumonomicon will display that research's internal id.

## Weighted Node Generation

## Arcane Levitator Behavior

**Config Option:** `levitatorShiftFix`
Modifies the Arcane Levitator behavior where only the shifting entity will be lowered, instead of all entities (including other players) on top of any given levitator, as well as no longer triggering when you press shift while a menu is open, like your inventory or chat.

Has the side effect of making non-shifting entities, like passive mobs, unable to be lowered.

## Pure Nodes Always Create Magical Forest

**Config Option:** `pureNodeAlwaysMagicalForest`

By default, pure nodes only change the biome around them if they are either in tainted lands or inside of a silverwood tree. This setting allows pure nodes to change the biome around them regardless of their location.

## Alternate Eldritch Altar Mob Spawning

**Config Option:** `eldritchAltarSpawningMethod`

Override how eldritch altars pick where to try spawning crimson knights and eldritch guardians. [The default approach is... unusual](https://github.com/rndmorris/Salis-Arcana/issues/99).

* `EVEN_SPREAD`: each valid coordinate in range has an equal chance of being selected. Will not try to spawn in spaces occupied by the altar itself.
* `CENTER_WEIGHTED`: weighted towards coordinates near the altar. Will not try to spawn in spaces occupied by the altar itself.

## Patterning Banners is Free

**Config option:** `bannerFreePatterns`

Applying patterns to banners not consume the phial or the essentia. Overrides `bannerReturnPhials` in the bugfixes module.

# Enhancements - Infusion

## Config option: `useStabilizerRewrite`

Rewrites the Runic Matrix's surroundings-check logic to be more flexible when checking for pedestals and stabilizers.
This is a significant change, and will conflict with any other mod that also modifies the matrix's
surroundings-checking logic.

## Config option: `stabilizerStrength`

Requires `useStabilizerRewrite=true`.

The amount (in one-hundredths of a point) of symmetry each stabilizer block adds to an infusion altar. If a stabilizer doesn't have a symmetrical opposite, an equivalent amount of symmetry will be subtracted instead.

Negative strengths will invert a stabilizer's behavior by stabilizing an infusion altar if placed asymmetrically, and destabilizing an altar if placed symmetrically.

The default value of `10` is equivalent to vanilla Thaumcraft's stabilizer strength.

## Config option: `stabilizerAdditions`

Requires `useStabilizerRewrite=true`.

A list of blocks that should be treated as infusion stabilizers, even if they normally would not. Each block should
be on its own line, and be in the format `modId:blockId` or `modId:blockId:metadata` or `modId:blockId:metadata`.

**Metadata:**
* Defaults to 0 if not set.
* If set to * or 32767, all metadata variants of the block will be included.

**Strength:**
* Defaults to `stabilizerStrength` if not set.
* Range: -10000 to 10000

<ins>Example:</ins>

* `minecraft:lapis_block` will include Minecraft's Lapis Lazuli Block
* `Thaumcraft:blockCosmeticSolid` or `Thaumcraft:blockCosmeticSolid:0` will include Thaumcraft's Obsidian Totem, but none of the block's other variants.
* `Thaumcraft:blockCosmeticSolid:*` or `Thaumcraft:blockCosmeticSolid:32767` will include Thaumcraft's Obsidian Totem, Obsidian Tile, Paving Stone of Travel/Warding, Thaumium Blocks, etc.
* `Thaumcraft:blockCosmeticSolid:0:20` will make obsidian totem blocks will contribute twice as much stability as normal stabilizers.
* `minecraft:skull:*:5` will make all vanilla Minecraft skulls contribute half as much stability as normal stabilizers.
* `Thaumcraft:blockCandle:*:0` will make all Thaumcraft candles count as stabilizers for their symmetrical twin, but not contribute any stability themselves.

## Config option: `stabilizerExclusions`

Requires `useStabilizerRewrite=true`.

A list of blocks that should *not* be treated as infusion stabilizers, even if they normally would. Each block should
be on its own line, and be in the format `modId:blockId` or `modId:blockId:metadata`.

If no metadata is specified, a default value of `0` will be used. If metadata is `*` or `32767`, metadata will be
ignored when determining if a block is present on this list.

<ins>Example:</ins>

* `minecraft:skull` or `minecraft:skull:0` will exclude skeleton skulls
* `minecraft:skull:2` will exclude zombie heads
* `minecraft:skull:*` or `minecraft:skull:32767` will exclude all minecraft skulls and heads
* `Thaumcraft:blockCandle:*` or `Thaumcraft:blockCandle:32767` will exclude all Thaumcraft candles

## How Additions and Exclusions Interact

If a block matches an entry on the Additions list, it is *always* treated as an infusion stabilizer, even if it also
appears on the Exclusions list. This interaction can be used to succinctly exclude only some existing stabilizers.

<ins>Example:</ins>

If the Additions list contains `Thaumcraft:blockCandle:10` (Purple Tallow Candles), and the Exclusions list contains
`Thaumcraft:blockCandle:*` (all Tallow Candles), Purple Tallow Candles will help stabilize an infusion but other colors
will not.

# Enhancements - Recipes

## Config option: `friendlyPrimalCharm`
Make the primal charm's crafting recipe less picky about the order in which primal shards are placed in the top and bottom rows.

## Config Option: `addEmptyPhialJarRecipes`
Adds crafting recipes to convert jars and phials of essentia into their empty variants.

# Enhancements - Wand Component Replacement

## Config option: `replaceCapsResearchCategory`, `replaceCapsResearchColumn` and `replaceCapsResearchRow`

Used to set the tab of the Thaumonomicon on which the "Wand Cap Substitution" research appears, and its position on that tab.

## Config option: `replaceCoreResearchCategory`, `replaceCoreResearchColumn` and `replaceCoreResearchRow`

Used to set the tab of the Thaumonomicon on which the "Wand Core Substitution" research appears, and its position on that tab.

## Config option: `enforceWandCoreTypes`

If enabled, prevents swapping a wand core with a staff core or a staff core with a wand core. Disable to allow converting a wand to a staff and vice versa.

## Config option: `allowSingleWandReplacement`

Requires `enableReplaceWandCapsRecipe=true` or `enableReplaceWandCoreRecipe=true`.

Requires `arcaneWorkbenchGhostItemFix=true` in the bugfixes module.

If enabled, allows swapping a wand's components using vis from the wand being modified.

# Enhancements - Vis Relay/Amulet Improvements:

## Config Option: `visRelayBoxExpansion`

Increases the range of the vis relay at which items like amulets will be charged. Default is 5, which means players will have to be within 5 blocks of the relay.

## Config Option: `visAmuletRechargeSpeed`

The rate, in ticks, at which the vis amulet will recharge itself.

## Config Option: `visAmuletTransferRate`

Used to control how much vis can be transferred to and from the vis amulet.
