# Biome Color Configuration
Config file: `config/salisarcana/biome_colors.cfg`

## Configuration
Each of Thaumcraft 4's four biomes (Eerie, Eldritch, Magical Forest, and Tainted Lands) can be configured independently.
Color overrides will only take effect if their respective `enable` config option is `true` and they are given a valid
hexadecimal color value.

**The colors that can be overridden are:**
* `Base Color`
* `Foliage Color` - Leaves and the like
* `Grass Color`
* `Sky Color`
* `Water Color` - This overrides water's color multiplier, rather than the color of water itself. Harder to notice than others.
